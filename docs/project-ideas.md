# Want to Contribute to a Project?

A common problem that we hear from attendees is not knowing what projects or libraries that they can contribute to. Here's a running list of projects that we personally find fantastic:

###  Resources: Below are a few of the resources we mentioned last night:
* [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/)
* [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/)
* [First Timer's Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

### Good First Time Repos:
[Node.js:](https://github.com/nodejs/node) A very welcoming community that is beginner friendly. Look for the label `good first contribution`.
[ASP.NET:](https://github.com/aspnet) Scott Hanselman does a lot of work here! Start in the docs.
[Habitica:](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica) An RPG for good habits (very cute). Look for `entry level coding`.
[Exercism.io:](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io) A code mentorship platform. Look for the label `good first patch`. This is great for Ruby developers as well.
[Leaflet:](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) A plug-in for custom maps. Look for the label `easy fix`.
[Operation CODE:](https://github.com/OperationCode) An open source organization that helps veterans find jobs in technology. Look for `beginner friendly`(Note: The link I included here is just for the front-end. They also have an excellent starter's guide here.)
[Tensorflow:](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) An open source machine learning platform. They don't have beginner-friendly labels, but have a strong Code of Conduct and support a variety of languages.
